            <h2>All About Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
            <p>Leonardo da Vinci was a famous renaissance painter, engineer, architect, inventor, and student of all things scientific. If you don't what the Renaissance were they were an age, a time, an era. It was a European cultural, artistic, political and economic "rebirth" that lead up to the Middle Ages, happened around the 14th though 17th centry.</p>
            <p>Leonardo da Vinci was born in the year of 1452 in Anchiano, Tuscany, which is Italy today. He grew up close to the small town of Vinci, which is were he got his surname that we are all so familiar with. Da Vinci's father Sir Peiro an attorney and notary was never married to Leonardo's peasant mother Caterina, Leo was the only child they had together. Da Vinci's uncle helped raise him, his uncle also a particular intrest for nature, which he shared with Leo.</p>
            <p>Leo didn't had a formal edutation beyond, reading, writing, and math. He also had great artistic abilities that his father was well pleased in. So his father discided to let him work. At the young age of 15 leonardo was an apprentice tonoted sculptor and painter Andrea del Verrocchio of Florence. At the age of 20, in 1472, Verrocchio offered him memership (own the store), but Da Vinci remained with Verrocchio until he was an independent master. when he was 30 around 1482 Leo began to paint his firts commmission piece for a Scopeto monastery. However he nerver finish because he went to go work for the ruling Sforza clan, in Milan, and served as a painter, engineer, architect, and inventor. There he created a magnificent 16-foot-tall equestrian statue, in bronze, to honor dynasty founder Francesco Sforza. It was an on and off project that took 12 years to complet. However imminent war broke and in that war the statue so how got hit by a cannon and was detroyed.</p>
            <p>Da Vinci is known for so much like the 'Mona Lisa' and so many other paitings like 'The Last Spper'. He's also famous for his many inventions like the bicycle, helicopter, submarine and military tank, which would not come until centeries later. He was a philosopher, with the the ideas were that he believed that sight was mankind’s most important sense and that “saper vedere” (“knowing how to see”) was crucial to living all aspects of life fully. Da Vinci’s interests ranged far beyond fine art. He also studied nature, mechanics, anatomy, physics, architecture, weaponry and more. but one of the most intresting things about him is the notebooks that he created, which were about painting, architecture, mechanics, but the most fasinnating entries were the ones about human anatomy —creating thousands of pages of neatly drawn illustrations and densely penned commentary.</p>
            <p>Da Vinci's last years were his happiest the bitter and draft tones in his painting tell us so. In 1519, Leonardo died at the age fo 67, in the town of Cloux (now Clos-Lucé). He was buried nearby in the palace church of Saint-Florentin. The French Revolution nearly obliterated the church, completly annihilating any remains if it, making it impossible to locate Da Vinci’s exact gravesite.</p>
            <p>It all goes to show that Da Vinci was a very instresting, devoted, and hardworking man, and was also way ahead of his time.</p>

                <p>Location: Louvre Museum, France</p>
                <p>While Leonardo da Vinci was in Florence he made a series of portraits, the the most famous is 'La Gioconda', a 21-by-31-inch delicacy, which in more familiar terms is the 'Mona Lisa'. The 'Mona Lisa' is one of the most famous pantings of all times. It took a good three years for this beautiful piece of art to be completed, ranging from the years c. 1503-1506. Its been the subject of speculation for centuries, because the woman depicted has such a mysterious slight smile.</p>

                <p>Leonardo da Vinci's Air Craft</p>
                <p>Leonardo studied the possibility of human mechanical flight. he also made more than 35,000 words and 500 sketches dealing with flying machines. These investigations of flight are scattered throughout the many da Vinci codices and manuscript collections. The project took place from 1505-1506.The name of this project was called the Codice sul volo degli uccelli (Codex on the Flight of Birds).</p>

                <p>What did da Vinci belive to be true?</p>
                <p>Da Vinci belived that sight was the most imortant sense for us human beings. He thought “saper vedere” (“knowing how to see”) was a key aspect to the fullest. He viewed art and science as a reward rather than distint disciplines. Probably because of his so many interests, da Vinci failed to complete a significant number of his paintings and projects. He spent alot of time immersing himself in natrue, testing scientific laws, dissecting bodies (human and animal) and writing all about his observations in his nook books. </p>

                <p>What was inside of the note books?</p>
                <p>Da Vinci's Nook books had a wide verity of topics and themes. For instance one of them are human anatomy. He created thousands of pages of neatly drawn illustrations and densely penned commentary. The note books entries about human anatomy included drwings of: human skeleton, muscles, brain, and digestive and reproductive systems. This brought a bigger and new understanding of the human body to so much more.</p>
